# AudioMetalizer
This project was made mostly for my personal use, but you are free to use it anyway, if you want.

Because I use the AudioEqualizer plugin when listening to music, the sound output is way louder than for normal videos or sounds of anything else.
But manually setting the volume every time was to much work for me, so now its just one click in the taskbar.

## Functionality
It has two modes: Standard mode which is 100% volume and Metal mode, which is 50% volume.
The current mode is viewable by hovering over and reading the tooltip or looking at the logo:
The full volume symbol means Standard mode, the Sabaton "S" means Metal mode.

Also there is a right-click menu, but its too many clicks and a bit awkward, but it is used to exit the application.
There also is Auto-Start functionality by default, although that is still not stable and can cause significant system stress.

# Copyright Disclaimer
The project uses multiple variations of icons from the band Sabaton (and yes, the Sabaton pun in the name is intended), since I made this app to use with their music.
I obiously dont have any rights to their logo.
